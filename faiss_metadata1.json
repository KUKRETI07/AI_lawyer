The Act vested in him the superintendence, direction and control of all acts, operations and concerns which in any way related to the Government or revenues of India.

Similar provisions were made by the Act of 1861 for Legislative Councils in the Provinces. But even for initiating legislation in these Provincial Councils with respect to many matters, the prior sanction of the Governor-General was necessary. Two improvements upon the preceding state of affairs as regards the Indian and Provincial Legislative Councils were introduced by the Indian Councils Act, 1892, namely that (a) though the A In c d t i , a 1 n 892 .Councils majority of official members were retained, the non ¬ official members of the Indian Legislative Council were henceforth to be nominated by the BengalChamberof Commerceand the Provincial Legislative Councils, while the non-official members of the Provincial Councils were to be nominated by certain local bodies such as universities, district boards, municipalities; (b) the Councils were to have the pow'er of discussing the annual statement of revenue and expenditure, it., the Budgetand of addressingquestionsto theExecutive.

As regards the special responsibilities, the Governor-General was to act under thecontroland directionsof theSecretaryofState. But, in fact, neither any ‘Counsellors nor any Council of Ministers responsible to the Legislature came to be appointed under the Act of 1935; the old Executive Council provided by the Act of 1919 continued to advise the Governor-General until the Indian Independence Act, 1947 . (c) The Legislature . The Central Legislature was bi-cameral, consisting of the Federal Assembly and theCouncilofState. In six of the Provinces, the Legislature was bi-cameral, comprising a wLegislative Assembly and a Legislative Council. In the rest of the Provinces, thewLegislaturewas uni - cameral. w The legislative powers of both the Central and Provincial Legislatures were subjec.tEto various limitations and neither could be said to have possessed the feaatures of a sovereign Legislature. Thus, the Central Legislaturewassubjesctto thefollowinglimitations: y (i) Apart from the Go E vernor-General’s power of veto, a Bill passed by the CentralLegislature wasalso n su g bject to veto by the Crown. i (ii) The Governor-General might nprevent discussion in the Legislature and suspend the proceedings in regard to eany Bill if he was satisfied that it e would affect the dischargeof hisspecial responsibrilities. i n (iii) Apart from the power to promulgate Ordinanc g es during the recess of the Legislature, the Governor-General had indepen.dent powers of n legislation, concurrendy with those of the Legislature. Thus, e he had the power tomake temporary Ordinancesaswell as permanent Actsattany time for thedischarge of hisspecial responsibilities. (iv) No bill or amendment could be introduced in the Legislature without the Governor - General’s previous sanction, with respect to certain matters, e.g., if the Bill or amendment sought to repeal or amend or was repugnant to any law of the British Parliament extending to India or any Governor-General’s or Governor’s Act, or if it sought to affect matters as respects which theGovernor-General wasrequired toact in his discretion.

Thefollowingwere the main resultsofsuch adaptations: (a) Abolition of the Sovereignty and Responsibility of the British Parlia¬ ment.Ashas been alreadyexplained, by theGovernmentof IndiaAct, 1858, the Government of India was transferred from the East India Company to the Crown. By this Act,the British Parliament became the directguardian of India, and the office of the Secretary of State for India was created for the administration of Indian affairs, for which the Secretary of State was to be responsible to Parliament Notwithstandinggradual relaxation of thecontrol, w the Governor-General of India and the Provincial Governors remained wsubstantially under the direct control of the Secretary of State until the Indwian IndependenceAct,1947,so that in . coEnstitutional theory, the Government of India is a subordinate official Governmenat underHisMajestysGovernment. and b T ra h n e ch In . d I i t a d n ec I s n la d r y e e p d e Et n h d a e t n w c i e th A e c f t fe a c l t te fr r o ed m t t h h i e s 1 co 5 n th st A itu u t g io u n s a t, l 1 p 9 o 4 s 7 iti ( o re n f , er r r o e o d t to as the 'appointed day), nIndia ceased to be a Dependency and the suzerainty of the British Crowgn over the Indian States and the treaty relationswithTribal Areas also lapsied n from thedate.

The Govemors-General of the two Dominions became the constitutional heads of the two new Dominions as in the case of the other Dominions.

As to its composition, it should be remembered, that it had been elected by indirect election by the members of the Provincial Legislative Assemblies (Lower House only), according to the scheme recommended by the Cabinet Delegation [seeTable II, in the Appendix].Theessentialsof this scheme wereasfollows: (1) Each province and each Indian State or group of States were allotted the total number of seats proportional to their respective populations roughly in the ratio of pne to a million. As a result, the Provinces were to elect 292 members while the Indian States were allotted a minimum of93seats. w(2) The seats in each province were distributed among the three main wcommunities, Muslim, Sikh and General, in proportion to their respwective populations. (3) Member.s E of each community in the Provincial Legislative Assembly elected theiraown representatives by the method of proportional representation wsith single transferable vote. y (4) The method of selectEion in the case of representatives of Indian States was to bedeterminend by consultation. g As a result of the Partition under thie Plan ofJune 3, 1947, a separate n Constituent Assembly was set up for Paki e stan , as stated earlier.

In fact, the conception of the Commonwealth itself has undergone a change owing to Indias decision to adhere to the Commonwealth, without acknowledging allegiance to the Crown which was the symbol of unity of the Old British Empire and also of itssuccessor, die British Commonwealdi of Nations’.5 It is this decision of India which has converted the British Commonwealth, a relic of imperialism, into a free association of independent nations under die honourable name of the ‘Commonwealdi of Nations. This historic decision took place at die Prime Ministers’ Conference at London on w April 27, 1949, where, our Prime Minister, Pandit Nehru, declared that w notwithstanding her becominga sovereign independent Republic, India will continue w her full membership of the Commonwealth of Nations and her acceptance o.fEthe King as the symbol of the free association of the independent nationasand assuch the Head of die Commonwealth. s y It is to be noted thatE diis declaration is extra legal and there is no mention of it in the Constitutionnof India. It is a voluntary declaration and indicates a free association and no ogbligation. It only expresses the desire of India not tosever her friendly relationsiwinth die English people even though the tie of political subjugation was severed.eThe new association was an honourable association between independent Sta e tes r. It accepts the Crown of England only as a symbolic head of the Commonwealtih n (having no functions to discharge in relation to India as belonged to higm prior to the Constitution), and having no claim to the allegiance of the citi.zenns of India. Even if the King or Queen of England visits India, he or she wilel not be entided to any precedence over the President of India. Again thought as a . member of the Commonwealth India has a right to be represented on Commonwealth conferences, decisions at Commonwealdi conferences will not be binding on her and no treaty with a foreign power or declaration of war by any member of the Commonwealth will be binding on her, without her express consent. Hence, this voluntary association of India with the Commonwealth does not affect her sovereignty to any extent and it would be open to India to cut off that association at any time she finds it not to be honourableor useful.

Any such surreptitious subversion of the Constitution was sought to be prevented by putting detailed provisions in the Constitution itself, so that they might not beencroached upon without amending theConstitution. The very adoption of the bulk of the provisions from the Government of India Act, 1935, contributed to the volume of the new Constitution inasmuch as the Actof 1935itself was a lengthy and detailed organic law. So much was borrowed from that Act because the people were familiar with the existingsystem. It was also felt that the smooth working of an infant democracy might be jeopardised4 unless the Constitution mentioned in detail things which were left in other Constitutions to ordinary legislation. This explains why we have in our Constitution detailed provisions about the organisation of the Judiciary, the Services, the Public Service Commissions, Elections and the wlike. It is the same ideal of exhaustiveness which explains why the pwrovisions of the Indian Constitution as to the division of powers between the Union and the Stales are more numerous than perhaps the aggregate of w the provisions relating to that subject in the Constitution of the U.S.A., .

In pursuance of this power, Parliament has enacteed the Citizenship Act, 1955, so that in order to have a full viewof the lawof citi e zen r shipin India,study of the Constitution has to be supplemented by that of theiC n itizenship Act. (ii) Similarly, while laying down certain fundamental safegguards against preventive detention, Ait. 22(7) empowers Parliament to legisla.tenon some subsidiary matters relating to the subject. The laws made under this epower, have, therefore, to be read along with the provisions of Art. 22. (iii) Ag t ain, while banning untouchability, Art. 17 provides dial it shall be an offence punishable in accordance with taw, and in exercise of this power, Parliament has enacted the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 19557 which must be referred to as supplementing the constitutional prohibition against untouchability. (iv) While the Constitution lays down the basic provisions relating to the election of the President and Vice-President, Art. 71(3) empowers Parliament to supplement these constitutional provisions by legislation, and by virtue of this power Parliament has enacted the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act,1952 . The obvious advantage of this scheme is that die law made by Parliament may be modified according to the exigencies for die time being, without having to resort toa constitutional amendment (b) There are, again,a number of articlesin the Constitution which are of a tentative or transitional nature and diey are to remain in force only so long as Parliament does not legislate on the subject, e.g., exemption of Union property from State taxation [Art. 285); suability of the State [Art.300(1) f Downloaded From : www.EasyEngineering.net Downloaded From : www.EasyEngineering.net",

It is through a misapprehension of these provisions that the Indian Constitution has been described by some critics as a ‘lawyers paradise’.12 According to Sir IvorJennings,10 this is due to the fact that the Constituent Assembly was dominated by ‘the lawyer-politicians’.

The idea of incorporating in the Constitution a ‘Bill of Rights’ has been taken from the Constitution of the United States. But the guarantee of individual rights in our Constitution has been very carefully balanced with the need for the security of the Stateitself. w wAmerican experience demonstrates that a written guarantee of fundamwental rights has a tendency to engender an atomistic view towards society and . the State which may at times prove to be dangerous to the common welfEare. Of course, America has been saved from the dangers of such a situation bay reason of her Judiciary propounding the doctrine of s ‘Police Powers’ under wyhich the Legislature is supposed to be competent to interfere with individual rigEhts wherever they constitute a ‘clear danger’ to thesafety of theStateand otherncollective interests. g Instead of leaving the matter to tihe off-chance of judicial protection in n particular cases, the Indian Constitution meakes each of the fundamental rights subject to legislative control under the teerms of the Constitution itself, apart from those exceptional cases where the int r eriests of national security, n integrity or welfare should exclude the application of g fundamental rights altogether [Arts.31A-31C].11 . n X. Another peculiarity of the Chapter on Fundamental Rieghts in the t Indian Constitution is that it aims at securing not Social Equality merely political or legal equality, but social equality as theconatitution. * well. Thus, apart from tire usual guarantees that the State will not discriminate between one citizen and another merely on the ground of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth, in the matter of appointment, or other employment, offered by the State, the Constitution includes a prohibition of ‘untouchability, in any form and lays down that no citizen may be deprived of access to any public place, of the enjoyment of any public amenity or privilege, only on the ground of religion,race,caste,sexor placeof birth. We can hardly overlook in this context that under the Constitution of tire U.S.A., racial discrimination persists even to-day, notwithstanding recent judicial pronouncements to the contrary.

Every power executive, legislative, orjudicial whether it belongs to the federation or to the component States, issubordinate toand controlled by the Constimtion. (iv) Authority of Courts. In a federal State the legal supremacy of the Constitution is essential to the existence of the federal system. It is essential to maintain die division of powers notonly between the coordinate branches of diegovernment,butalso between the Federal Government and theStates themselves. This is secured by vesting in the Courts a final power to interpret the Constitution and nullify an action on the part of the Federal and State Governments or their different organs which violates the provisionsof theConstitudon. The Supreme Court has observed that Indian Constitution is basically federal in form and is marked by the traditional characteristics of a federal system, namely, supremacy of the Constitution, division of power between tfie wUnion and dieStatesand existenceof an independent judiciary.11 Notwmuch pains need to be taken to demonstrate that the political system introduwced by ourConstitution possessesall the aforesaid essentials of a federal polity. T.hus, the Constitution is the supreme organic law of our land, and both the E Un a ion and die State Governments as well as their respective organs derive diseir authority from die Constitution, and it is not competent for the States to syecede from the Union .

A federal union of the American type is formed by a voluntary agreement between a number ofsovereign and inde ¬ pendent States, for the administration of certain affairsof general concern. But there is an alternative mode of the Canadian type (if Canada is admitted into the family of federations), namely, that the provinces of a unitary State may be transformed into a federal union to make themselves autonomous. The provinces of Canada had no separate or independent existence apart from the colonial Government of Canada, and the Union was not formed by any agreement between them, but was imposed by a British statute, which withdrew from the Provinces all their former rights and then re-divided them between the Dominion and the Provinces.Though the Indian federation resembles the Canadian federation in its centralising Downloaded From : www.EasyEngineering.net Downloaded From : www.EasyEngineering.net",

The Provincial Governments were virtually die agents of the Central Government, deriving powers by delegation from thelatter (see pp. 1 - 8, ante) . To appreciate the mode of formation of federation in India, we must go back to the Government of India Act, 1935, which for the first lime introduced the federal concept, and used the expression Federation of India (s.5) in a Constitution Act relating to India, since the Constitution has simply continued the federal system so introduced by the Act of 1935,so far as the Provinces of British Lidia are concerned.The foundation for a federal set-up for the nation was laid in the Gov 't , of India Act, 1935. Though in every respect the distribution of legislative power between the Union and the States as envisaged in the 1935 Act has not been adopted in the Consti ¬ wtution, but the basic framework is the same.13The Supreme Court observed twhat India has adopted for itself a loose federal structure as it is an indestructible Union of destructible units.14 w By th.e Act of 1935, the British Parliamentset up a federalsystem in the E same manner as it had done in the case of Canada, s F a e g d e e d ration by as ena th vi e - s viz., by creating autonomous units and combining Government of tyhem into a federation by one and the same Act . .All IndiaAct, 1935. powEers hitherto exercised in India were resumed by the Crownn and redistributed between the Federation g and the Provinces by a direct grant. Under this system, the Provinces i derived their authority directly from thenCrown and exercised legislative and e executive powers, broadly free from Centr e al control, within a defined sphere. Nevertheless, the Centre retained controrl through ‘the Governors i special responsibilities’ and his obligation to exnercise his individual judgment and discretion in certain matters, and the powger of the Centre to givedirection tothe Provinces.15 . n The peculiarity of thus converting a unitary system into a feede t ral one can be best explained in the words of theJoint Parliamentary Committee on Indian Reforms: Ofcourse in thusconvertinga unitaryState intoa federation we should be taking a step for which there is no exact historical precedent. Federations have commonly resulted from an agreement between independent or, at least, autonomous Governments, surrendering a defined part of their sovereignty or autonomy to a new central organism. At the present moment the British Indian Provincesare not evenautonomousfor they aresubjectto bothadministrativeand IcgislaUve control of the Government and such authority as they exercise has been in the main devolved upon them under a statutory rule-making power by the Governor- General in Council.

The Provinces,asjustseen, had been artificially madeautonomous, within a defined sphere, by the Government of India Act, 1935. What die makers of the Constitution did was to associate the Indian States with these autonomous Provinces into a federal union, which die Indian States had refused toaccede to,in 1935. Some amount of homogeneity of die federating units is a condifion for their desire to form a federal union. But in India, the posidon has been different. From the earliest times, the Indian States had a separate polidcal endty, and there was little that was common between them and the Provin ¬ ces which constituted the rest of India. Even under die federal scheme of 1935 the Provinces and the Indian States were treated differendy; the acce ¬ ssion o w f the Indian States to the system was voluntary while it was compul ¬ sory for die w Provinces, and the powers exercisable by die Federation over the Indian States were also to be defined by die Instruments of Accession It w is because it was optional with the Rulers of the Indian States that diey refus ¬ ed to join the federa.lEsystem of 1935. They lacked the federal sentiment [Dicey),that is, the desire toaform a federal union with the rest of India.

(iii) In the matter of amendment of die Constitution, again, the part assigned to the Stale is minor, as compared widi that of the Union. The doctrine underlying a federation of die American type is that die union is the result of an agreement between the component units, so dial no part of the Constitution which embodies die compact can be altered without the consent of the covenanting parties.This doctrine is adopted, with variations, by mostof the federalsystems. w But in India, except in a few specified matters affecting the federal s w tructure (see Chap. 10, post) , the States need not even be consulted in the matte w r of amendment of the bulk of the Constitution, which may be effected by a Bill in .tEhe Union Parliament, passed by a special majority.

The same principle is adopted in the Australian Constitution to make the Commonwealth indissoluble”, with the further safeguard superadded that a popular referendum is required in the affectedState toalter its boundaries.

The Constitution does not require that the consent of the Legislature of the States is necessary for enabling Parliament to make such laws; only the President has to ascertain the views of the Legislature of the affected States to recommend a Bill for this purpose to Parliament. Even this obligation is not mandatory insofar as the President is competent to fix a time-limit within which a State must express its views, if at all [Proviso to Art. 3, as amended]. In the Indian federation, thus, theStates are not indestructible’’ units asin the U.S.A. The ease with which the federal organisation may be reshaped by an ordinary legislation by the Union Parliament has been demonstrated by the enact¬ ment of the States Reorganisation Act, 195b, which reduced the number of States from 27 to 14 within a period of six years from tire commencement of the Cwonstitution.

To this is superadded the guarantee that no State may, without its consent, be deprived of its equal representation in the Senate |Art. V). Under our Constitution, there is no equality of representation of the States in the Council of States. As given in die Fourth No eaualitv of Stale representa Schedule, the number of members for the several tion. States varies from 1 to31. In view of such composition of the Upper Chamber, the federal safeguard against the interests of the lesser States being overridden by the interests of the larger or more populated States is absent under our Constitution.

Like the Crown of England, the President of India is a component part of the Union Parliament and here is one of the instances where the Indian Constitution departs from the principle of Separation of Powers underlying the Constitution of the United States. The legislative powers of the Indian President, of course according to ministerial advice, [Art. 74(1)] are various and may be discussed under the following heads: (a) Summoning, Prorogation,Dissolution. Like tlie English Crown our President shall have the power tosummon or prorogue die Housesof Parliament and todissolve the lower House.11' He shall also have the power to summon a joint sitting of both Houses of . Parliament in caseofadeadlock between diem|Arts 85, 108], (b) The Opening Address. w The President shall address both Houses of Parliament assembled w together, at the first session after each general election to the House of the Peopl w e and at die commencement of the first session of each year, and inform Pa.rlEiamentof thecausesofitssummons [Art . 87] . The practi a ce during die last five decades shows that the Presidents s Opening Address is byeing used for purposes similar to those for which the Speech from die ThroEne Is used in England, viz., to announce die programme of die Cabinet fnor the session and to raise a debate as to die political oudook and matters o g f g i eneral policy or administration. Each House is empowered by the Constitutinon to make rules for allotting time for discussion of die matters referred to in suc e h e address and for die precedence ofsuch discussion over other businessof the Horuse. i n (c) The Right toAddress andtosend Messages. g . Besides the right to address a joint sitting of bodi nHouses at the e commencement of the first session, the President shall also have thte right to address either House or their joint sitting, at any time, and to require the attendance of members for this purpose [Art. 86(1)]. This right is no doubt borrowed from the English Constitudon, but there it is not exercised by the Crown except on ceremonialoccasions. Apart from the right to address, die Indian President shall have the right tosend messages to either House of Parliament either in regard to any pending Bill or to other matter, and the House must then consider the message “with all convenient despatch [Art. 86(2)]. Since the time of George III, die English Crown hasceased to takeany part in legislativeor to influence it and messages are now sent only on formal matters. The American President, on the other hand, possesses the right to recommend legislative measures to Congress by messages though Congressis not bound toaccept them. The Indian President shall have the power to send messages not only on legislative matters but also odierwise’.

(d) Nominating Memberstothe Houses.

(e) laying Reports, etc.,before Par E liame n nt . The President is brought into contact g wit i h Parliament also through his power and duty to cause certain reports and sntatements to be laid before Parliament, so that Parliament may have the oppo e rtu e nity of taking action upon them. Thus, it is the duty of the President to causerto be laid before Parliament (a) the Annual Financial Statement (Bu i dgnet) and the Supplementary Statement, if any; (b) the report of the Auditgor-General relating to the accounts of the Government of India; (. c)nthe recommendations made by the Finance Commission, together with aen t explanatory memorandum of the action taken thereon; (d) the n;port of the Union PublicServiceCommission,explainingthe reasons where any advice of the Commission has not been accepted; (e) the report of the Special Officer for Scheduled Castes and Tribes; (f) the report of the Commission on backward classes; (g) the report of the Special Officer for linguistic . minorities (f) factioussanctiontolegislation.

From the standpoint of effect on the legislation, executive vetos have been classified asabsolute, qualified,suspensiveand pocket vetos . (B) Absolute Veto. The English Crown possesses the prerogative of absolute veto, and if it refuses assent to any bill, it cannot become lawr, notwithstanding any vote of Parliament. But this veto power of the Crown has become obsolete since 1700, owing to the development of the Cabinet system, under which all public legislation is initiated and conducted in the Legislature by the Cabinet.Judged by practice and usage, thus there is at present noexecutive power of vetoin England , (C) Qualified Veto. A veto is qualified when it can be overridden by an ewxtraordinary majority of tire Legislature and the Bill can be enacted as law with swuch majority vote, overriding the executive veto. The veto of the American Presiwdent is of this class. When a Bill is presented to the President, he may, if he does.not assent to it, return the Bill within 10 days, with a statementof his objec E tions,to that branch of CongressffTwtttdnt originated . a i E n ac e h ac H h ou H se ou o s f e, Co b n y gr a es t s w t o h - e th n s ir r dy e s co v n o s t i e de o rs f t t h h e e B m iff em an b d er i s f it pr is es a e d n o t . pte t d he ag B ai i n ll - becomes a lawr notwithstandingTEhe absence oF the Presidents signature. The qualified veto is then overridden. Bnut if it fails to obtain that two-thirds g majority, the veto stands and the Bill fails to become law. In die result, the i qualified veto senes as a means to the Executivento point out the defects of the legislation and to obtain a reconsideration bey the Legislature, but e ultimately die extraordinary majority of the Legislaturre prevails. The qualified veto is thus a useful device in the United Staitens where the Executive has no power of control over the Legislature, by progrogation, dissolutionor otherwise. . n e (D) Suspensive Veto. A veto is suspensive when the executive veto can t be overridden by die Legislature by an ordinary majority. To this type belongs die veto power of die French President.Tf , upon a reconsideration, Parliament passes die Bill agam ~Gy~ a ~ simple majority, the President has no option but to promulgateit. (E) Pocket Veto. There is a fourth type of veto called die pocket veto which is possessed by the American President. When a Bill is presented to him, he may neidier sign the Bill nor return the Bill for reconsideration widiin 10 days. He may simply let the Bill lie on his desk until the ten-day limit has expired. But, if in the meantime, Congress has adjourned [i.e., before expiry of the period of ten-days from presentation of the Bill to the President), the Bill fails to become a law. Jhis method is known as die pocket veto’, for, by simply withholding a Bill presented to ~ the PresTHent during the last few daysof the session of Congress die President can prevent ~ ~ - the Bill toUecomc law .

Even with tfre introduction of full Ministerial responsibility, the same provision has been IncorporatedTin the Constitution of India. Normally, this power will be exercised only in the case ol private members Bills. In the case of a Government Bill, a situation may, however, be imagined, where after the passage of a Bill and before it is assented to by the President, the Ministry resigns and the next Council of Ministers, commanding a majority in Parliament, advises the President to use his veto power against the Bill. In such a contingency,it would be constitutional on the part of the President to use his veto power even though the Bill had been duly passed by Parliament.13 w w (ii) If, however, instead of refusing his assent outright, the President remits the Bill or any portion of it for reconsideration,a re-passage of the Bill w by an ordinary majority would compel the President to give his assent.This . power of thEe Indian President, thus, differs from the qualified veto in the United States insaofar as no extraordinary majority is required to effect tire enactment of a retu s rne y d Bill.

Article 111 simeply says that if the President wants to return the Bill, he shall do it as soon ras i possible after the Bill is presented to him.

Besides the power to veto Union legislation, the President of India shall also have the power of disallowance or return for reconsideration of a Bill of the State Legislature, which may have been reserved for his consideration by the Governor of the State [Art. 201] , Reservation of a State Bill for the assent of the President is a discretionary power13 of the Governor of a State. In the case of any Bill presented to the Governor for his assent after it has been passed by both Houses of die Legislature of the State, the Governor may, instead of giving his assent or withholding his assent, reserve the Bill for the consideration of the President.

The ambit of this Ordinancemaking power of the President is co extensive with the legislative powers of Parliament, that is to say, it may ¬ relate to any subject in respect of which Parliament has the right to legislate and is subject to the same constitutional limitations as legislation by Parliament.Thus,an Ordinance cannot con.travene the Fundamental Rights any more than an Act of Parliament.

He shall have no such power while both Houses of Parliament are in session. The President’s Ordinance-making power under the Constitution is, thus, not a co-ordinate or parallel power of legislation available while the Legislatureiscapableof legislating.

But the argument would not hold good where the Government of the day did not carry an overwhelming majority. Article 123 would, in such a situation, enable die Government to enact a measure for a temporary period by an Ordinance, not being sure of support in Parliament il a Bill had been brought. Even where the Government has a clear majority in Parliament, a debate in Parliament which takes place where a Bill is introduced not only gives a nadon - wide publicity to the pros and coas of the measure but alsogives to the two Houses a chance of making amendments to rectify unwelcome features or defects as may be revealed by the debate.

At the Centre, these categories are Salaries of Minis- three, as stated above.Thesalaries and allowances of ters. Ministers shall be such as Parliament may from time to time by law determine. Each Minister gets a sumptuary allowance at a varyingscale,accordingto his rank,and a residence,freeof rent. The rank of thedifferent Ministersisdetermined by the Prime Minister according to whose advice the President appoints the Ministers\\Art . 75[\\)\\, and awlso allocates business amongst them \\Art.77\\. While the Council of Ministers iswcollectively responsible to the House of the People (Art . 75(3)], Art. 78(c) enjoinws the Prime Minister, when required by the President, to submit for theconsid . eration of the Councilof Ministersany matteron which adecision has been tak E en by a Minister but which has not been considered by the Council, in practi a ce, s the Council of Ministers seldom meets as a body. It is the Cabinet, an innerybody within the Council, which shapes the policyof theGovernment. E While Cabinet Ministers attend me n etin g gs of the Cabinet of their own right, Ministersof State are not membersof theiCabinetand they can attend only ifinvited to attend any particular meeting.

The collective responsibility has two meanings : the first that all the members of a government are unanimous in support of its policies and exhibit that unanimity on public occasions although while formulating the policies, they might have differed in thecabinet meeting;thesecond that the Ministers, who had an opportunity tospeak for or against die policies in the Cabinetare thereby personally and morallyresponsiblefor thensuccessand failure.

The resuElt, is that though the Ministers are collectively responsible to the Legislature, th a ey s shall be individually responsible to the Executive head and shall be liable to diysmissal even when they may have the confidence of the Legislature. But since thEe Prime Ministers advice will be available in the matter of dismissing other Min n isters individually, it may be expected that g this power of the President will virtuailly be, as in England, a power of the Prime Minister against his colleague n s, to get rid of an undesirable e colleague even where that Minister may still epossess the confidence of the majority in the House of the People. Usually, thre P i rime Minister exercises this power by asking an undesirable colleague to re n sign, which the latter readilycomplieswith,in order toavoid theodium of a di g smissal. . (C) But, as stated earlier, the English principle of legal n res e ponsibility has not been adopted in ourConstitution. In England, the Crown catnnot do any public act without the counter-signature of a Minister who is liable in a Court of law if the act done violates the law of the RefDonsibilit v land and gives rise toacauseof action in favour of an individual. But our Constitution does not expressly say that the President can act only through Ministers and leaves it to the President to make rules as to how his orders, etc., are to be authenticated; and on the other hand, provides that the Courts will not be entitled to enquire what advice was tendered by the Ministers to the executive head. Hence, if an act of the President is, according to the rules made by him, authenticated by a Secretary to tire Government of India, there is no scope for a Minister being legally responsible for the act even though it may have been doneon theadviceof the Minister. As in England, the Prime Minister is the “keystone of the Cabinet arch .Article 74(1) of our Constitution expresslystates Special position of that tjle p me Minister shall be at the head of the inCthe\" council * of Council of Ministers.

In a Parliamentary form of government, die tenure of office of die virtual executive is dependent on the will of the Legislature; in a Presidendal Government die tenure of office of the executive is independent of the will of the Legislature [Leacock) . Thus, in the Presidendal form of which the model is the United States, the President is the real head of the Execudve who is elected by die people for a fixed term. He is independent of the Legislature as regards his tenure and is not responsible to the Legislature for hisacts. He may, of course, act with die advice of ministers, but they are appointed by him its his counsellors and are responsible to him and not to the Legislature wUnder the Parliamentarysystem represented by England, on the other hand, thewhead of the Executive (die Crown) is a mere titular head, and the virtual executivwe power is wielded by the Cabinet, a body formed of the members of the Legisl . ature and responsible to the popular House of the Legislature for their office E and actions . a Being a Republisc, India could not have a hereditary monarch .

While die so-called Cabinet of the American President is responsible to himself and not to Congress, die Council of Ministers of our President shall be responsible to Parliament. The reason why the framers of the Constitution discarded the American model after providing for die election of the I*resident of the Republic by an electoral college formed of members of the Legislatures not only of the Union but also of the States, has thus been explained2\": hi combining stability with responsibility, they gave more importance to the latter and preferred the system of 'daily assessment of responsibility to the theory of ‘periodic assessment’ upon which the American system is founded. Under the American system, conflicts are bound to occur between the Execudve, Legislature and Judiciary; and on the other hand, according to many modem American waiters the absence of co-ordination between the legis¬ lature and the Executive is a source of weakness of the American political system.

A more debatable question that has been raised is whether the Constitution obliges the President to act only on the advice of the Council of Ministers, on every matter. The controversy, on this question, was highlighted by a speech delivered by the President Dr. Rajendra Prasad ata ceremony of the Indian Law Institute (November28, I960)28where he urged for a study of the relationship between the President and the Council of Ministers,observingthat There is no provision in theConstitution which insomany words laysdown that thePresidentshall be bound toactin accordance with theadviceofhisCouncilof Ministers. The above observation came in contrast with the words of Dr. Rajendra Prasad himself with which he, as the Presi Status of the Presi- ¬ dent of India. dent of the Constituent Assembly, summed up the w relevant provisions of the Draft Constitution:28 w “Although there isnospecific provision in theConstitution itself makingit binding on the Prwesident to accept the advice of his ministers, it is hoped that the convention unde . r which in England the King always acted on the adviced of his ministers would bEe established in this country also and the President would becomeaconstitutionalaPresidentinallmatters.” s Politicians and scholars, nyaturally, took sides on this issue, advancing different provisions of the ConstituEtion to demonstrate that the President under our Constitution is not a figure-henad” (Munshij29or that he was a mere constitutional head similar to theEnglish Crgown. i When the question went up to the Supremne Court, the Court took the latter view, relying on the interpretation of the wordes aid and advise in the e Dominion Constitution Acts,in thesewords,in RamJawayru'scase11: i Underarticle53(1)ofour Constitution theexecutive powerof thenUnion isvested in the President. But underarticle74 there isto be a Council of Ministgers with tile Prime Minister at the head to aid and advise the President in the exercis.e n of his functions.

Tile President withheld his assent to the Bill on the ground that\non 8-3-1954, Parliament had no power to exercise the legislative powers of the PEPSU\nState and that. accordingly, the President could not give nis assent to the Bill to enact a\nlaw which was beyond the competence of Parliament to enact on that date.\n\nThe Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament (Amendment) Bill,\n1991 was ipassed by the Houses of Parliament on the last dav of its sitting, without\nobtaining the President's recommendation as required by Art. 117(1). It was presented to\nthe President for his assent on 18th March, 1991. The Resident withheld his assent to it.\n(Rajya Sabha, Parliamentary Bulletin Part /, dated March 9, 1992),\n\nThis shows that the veto power is necessary to prevent the enactment of Bills which\nappear to be ultra vires or unconstitutional at the lime when the Bill is ready for the\n\nresident's assent. It also shows that there may be occasions when Government may have\nto advise the President to veto a Bill which had been introduced by the Government\nitself.\n\n14. In 1986 both the Houses passed the Indian Post Office (Amendment) Bill, 1986. It was\nwidely criticised as Curtalling the Freedom of the Press. President Zail Singh did not\ndeclare his assent or that he withheld his assent. It was all the time in the ‘pocket’ of the\nPresident.\n\nAfter the formation of the National Front Government in December, 1989, the\nPresident R. Venkatafaman referred it back for reconsideration and the Prime Mimstei\ndeclared that it would be brought again before the Houses of Parliament, with suitable\nchanges. It appears certain that it aie given Up.\n\n15. lloechst Pharmaceuticals v. Slate of Bihar, AIR 1953 S.C. 1019 (para 89).\n\n16, Lakhinarayan y, Prov, of Bihar, AIR 1950 F.C. 59; State of Punjab v.

State of Bihar, AIR\n1987 S.C. 579. In. this case, it was established dial the Government of Bihar, instead of\nlaying before the State Legislature an Ordinance as required by Art. cae of die\nConstitution corresponding to Art. 12302)(al or having an Ordinance replaced by an\nAct of the Legislature, before the expiry ol the Ordinance on the lapse of the time\nspecified in the Constitution, would prolong its duration by re-promulgating it, ie., by\nissuing another new Ordinance to replace the Ordinance which would have otherwise\nexpired. In this manner. some 256 Ordinances were kept alive (up to a length of 14 years\nin some cases) without getting an Act passed by the State Legislature in place of the |\nexpiring Ordinance. The Supreme Court held that the power of die Governor to\npromulgate an Ordinance was in the nature of an emergency power. Hence, though in\nsome rare cases when an Act to replace an Ordinance could not be passed by the\nLegislature in time as it was loaded with other business; but if it was made a usual\nractice So as to establish legislation by the Executive (or an ‘Ordinance Raf) instead of\nby the legislature, as envisaged by the Constitution, dial would amount to a fraud on the\nConstitution, on which ground, the Court would strike down the repromulgated\nOrdinance. The substance of this decision is, therefore, dial in extreme cases. a Court\nmay invalidate an Ordinance on die ground of fraud and it affirms the trend since\nCooper's case (f.n. 18, below}.\n\n17.

(ii) Proportional representation is ill-suited to the Parliamentary system of government laid down by the Constitution. Qne of the disadvantages o£ the system of proportional representation is the fragmentation of the 'Legislature into a number of small groups. Although the British Parliament appointed a Ruval CuilllTUiiltm in h/ lU to consider the advisability of introducing proportional representation and the Commission recommended . it Parliament did not eventually accept the recommendations of the Commission on the ground that the proportional representation would not permit a stable Government. Parliament would be so~3Ivi3ed into small groups that every time anything happened which displeased certain groups in Parliament , drey would on those occasions withdraw support to the Government with the result that the Government, losing the support of certain groups, would fall to pieces.

Executive cannot impose any tax gwithout legislative sanction . If any tax is imposed with . onut legislative authority,the aggrieved person can obtain his relieffrom thecourtseof law . t (ii) As regards expenditure, the pivot of parliamentary control is the Consolidated Fund of India.Thisis the reservoir into which all the revenues received by the Government of India as well as all loans raised by it are paidand theConstitution providesthat no moneysshall beappropriated out of the Consolidated Fund of India except in accordance with law [Art.266(3)]. This law means an Act of Appropriation passed in conformity with Art. 114. Whether the expenditure is charged on tire Consolidated Fund of India or it is an amount voted by the House of the People, no money can be issued out of the Consolidated Fund of India unless the expenditure is authorised by an Appropriation Act\\Art . 114(3)]. It follows, accordingly, that tire executive cannot spend the public revenue without parliamentarysanction. While an Act of Appropriation ensures that there cannot be any expenditure of the public revenues without the sanction of Parliament, Parliaments control over the expenditure cannot be complete unless it is able to ensure economy in the volume of expenditure.

In West Bengal, in 1967, Governor Dharma Vira, being of the view that the United Front Ministry, led be Ajoy Mukheijee, had lost majority in the Legislative Assembly, owing to defections from that Party, asked the Chief Minister to call a meetingof Assembly at ashort notice,and,on the latters refusal to do so, dismissed the Chief Minister with his Ministry. On the other hand, in Uttar Pradesh in 1970, Governor Gopala Reddy dismissed Chief Minister Charan Singh, on a similar assumption, without even waiting for the verdict of the Assembly which wasscheduled to meet only a few days later.Quite a novel thing happened in Uttar Pradesh in 1998when the Governor Romesh Bhandari, being of the view that the Chief Minister Kalyan Singh Ministry had lost majority in the Assembly, dismissed him without affording him opportunity to prove his majority on the floor of the House and appointed wSnriJagdambika Pal as the Chief Minister which was challenged by Shri wKalyan Singh before the High Court which by an interim order put Shri Kalyan Singh again in position as the Chief Minister. This order was w challenged by Shri Jagdambika Pal before the Supreme Court which directed . aEcomposite floor test\" to be held between the contending parties which resultedain Shri Kalyan Singh securing majority . Accordingly, the impugned interimsorderof the High Court was madeabsolute.17 y Before answering Ethe question with reference to the preceding instances, it should be notednthat the Cabinet system of Government has beenadopted in ourConstitutiongfrom the United Kingdom and some of the salient conventions underlying the Biri n tish system have been codified in our Constitution. In the absence of anythingeto the contrary in the context, therefore, it must be concluded that the poseition under our Constitution is r thesameasin theUnited Kingdom. i n In England, the Ministers being legally the servangts of the Crown, at law the Crown has the power to dismiss each Minister,.individually or n collectively. But upon the growth of the Parliamentary system, eit has been established that the Ministers, collectively, hold their office so longtas they command a majority in the House of Commons. This is known as the collective responsibility’ of Ministers. The legal responsibility of the Ministers, as a collective body, to the Crown has thus been replaced by the political responsibility of the Ministry to Parliament, and the Crown’s power to dismiss a Prime Minister of his Cabinet has become obsolete, the last instance being 1783.18The Crown retains, however, his power to dismiss a Minister individually and, in practice, this power is exercised by the Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister himself, when he seeks to weed out an undesirablecolleague. Be that as it may, the above two propositions as they exist today in England have been codified in Cls. (1) and (2) of Art 164 of our Constitution asfollows: (1).. .andtheMinistersshallholdofficeatthepleasureoftheGovernor: (2) The Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the Legislattu AssemblyoftheState.

The first officialactof the ConstituentAssembly of the State was to put an end to the hereditary princely rule of the Maharaja. It was one of the conditions of the acceptance of the accession by the Government of India that the Maharaja would introduce popular Government in the State. In pursuance of this understanding, immediately after the Accession, the Maharaja invited Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, President of the AllJammu & Kashmir National Conference, to form an interim Government, and to w carry on the administration of the State.

When Indian leaders pressed for local autonomy at the national level, the British Government sought to meet this demand by offering concession at the lowest level, at the initial stage, by giving powers of self-government to Panchayats in rural area and municipwalities in urban areas, under various local names under different enactments,we.g. die Bengal Local Self-Government Act, 1885; the Bengal VillageSelf-Govewrnment Act,1919;die Bengal Municipal Act,1884. . In the GovernmenEt of India Act, 1935, die power to enact legislation was specifically given to tahe Provincial Legislature by Entry 12 in the . s Provincial Legislative List By virytue of this power, new Acts were enacted by many other States vesting power E s of administration, including criminal n justice, in die handsof the Panchayats. g i Notwithstanding such existing legislationn, die makers of die e Constitution of Independent India were not much satisf e ied with the working of these local bodies as institutions of popular governmenrt and, therefore, a i Directive was included in the Constitution of 1949in Ait.40asnfollows; g The slate shall take steps to organise village panchayats and endow th.em n with such powersand authorityasmay be necessary toenable them tofunction as uneits ofself-government\" t - But notwithstanding diis Directive in Art. 10, not much attention was given to hold elections in these local units as a unit of representative democracy in the country as a whole. During die timeof Mr. Rajeev Gandhi it wasconsidered necessary to further theorganisation of these local units by inserting specific provisions in the Constitution itself on the basis of which the Legislatures of the various States might enact detailed laws according to dieguidelines provided by the Constitutional provisions. The ideas so evolved, culminated in the passing of Constitution 73rd and 74di Amendment Acts, 1992 which inserted Parts Constitution * DC and IX-A in die Constitution.

So far as the judicial power of a High CourtJudge is concerned, he ranks as an equal to every other member of a Bench and is not expected, according to any principle relating to the administration of justice, to agree with die Chief justice or any other senior member of a Bench where his learning, conscience or wisdom dictates odierwise, or to stay his hands where the merits of a case require a judgment against the Government.

As regards the subjects of legislation, the Constitution adopts from die Government of India Act, 1935, a threefold Distribution of distribution of legislative powers between the Union 'C and the States \\Art. 246]. While in the United States Subjects and Australia, there is only a single enumeration of powers, only the powers of the Federal Legislature being enumerated, in Canada there is a double enumeration, and the Government of I.ndia Act, 1935, introduced a scheme of threefold enumeration, namely Federal, Provincial and Concurrent. The Constitution adopts this scheme from the Act of 1935 by enumerating possible subjects of legislation under three Legislative Listsin Sell. VIIof dieConstitution (see Fable XLX).4 List I or the Union list includes (in 2008) 100subjects over which the Union shall have exclusive power of legislation. These . include defence, foreign afwfairs, banking, insurance, currency and coinage Union duties and . taxes w List II or thewState List comprises 61 items or entries over which the State Legislature shall .have exclusive power of legislation, such as public orderand police,localgov E ern a ment, public healdi and simitation, agriculture, forests,fisheries,State taxesand dsuties. y List III gives concurrent powers toEthe Union and the . State Legislatures over 52 items, such as Criminal law annd procedure Civil procedure, marriage, contracts, torts, trusts, welfare of lgabour, economic and social i planningand education. n e In case of overlapping of a matter as betweenethe diree Lists, predominance has been given to die Union Legislature,ra i s under the G leg o i v s e la r t n e m w e i n th t o r f es I p n e d c i t a to Ac m t, at 1 t 9 e 3 rs 5. e T nu h m us e , ra d t i e e d p i o n w t e h r e o S f ta d t i e e L S i t s a t te ha L s en b g e is e l g n atu m r . e ad to e s e u n b u j m ec e t ra t t o ed d i i n e th p e ow U e n r ion of an P d ar C li o am nc e u n r t ren to t L le is g ts is , l a at n e d i t n he r e e n sp tr e ie c s t in of di m e a S tt t ne a r te s e t List havetobeinterpreted accordingly.

The Eighth Finance Commission submitted its report in 1984, but its recommendations, granting moneys to the States , were not implemented by die Government ol India, on the ground of financial difficulties and late receipt of the Commission's Report.
